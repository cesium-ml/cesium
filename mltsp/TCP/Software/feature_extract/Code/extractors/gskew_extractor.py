Of course, for RCBs near the detection limit this wont be that helpful, and for highly active RCBs it may not be great, but for your typical RCB is should separate out from other things. Im curious to see what this produces for SRPV and Mira sources.

Note - Ive arbitrarily selected 3 percent here. It could be 5 percent or 10, we should probably test a few different values to see how much difference it makes.

How to make a new release of ``cesium``
=======================================

- Add the version number as an annotated tag in git::

   git tag -s -m "Description of release" v0.X.Y

  You can look at existing tags with::

   git tag -l -n9

- Push the new meta-data to github::

   git push --tags origin main

- The CI will build wheels and upload to PyPi.

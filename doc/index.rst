Summary
-------

`cesium` is an open source library that allows users to:

- extract features from raw time series data (`see the feature table <./feature_table.html>`_),
- build machine learning models from these features, and
- generate predictions for new data.

More information and `examples <http://cesium-ml.org/docs/auto_examples/index.html>`_ can be found on our `home page <http://cesium-ml.org>`_.
